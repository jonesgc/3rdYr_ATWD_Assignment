        Critical Evaluation for ATWD1 assignment for Gregory Jones 16036844
    </p><br/>

        <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
        In this assignment I felt I learnt about REST api practices and standards, rather than PHP which was covered last year in DSAA. However for this assignment I do believe I explored further into PHP than last year. Using the manual for PHP to better locate functions for tasks I would have previously done by hand, such as isset or array_key_exists. With regards to the REST API once I had gotten the basics I think most of my learning outcomes related to writing the client javascript AJAX querys then handling them in PHP, such as using the php file stream. For broader REST knowledge I found that the research I needed to do at the start of this assignment was when I learnt most about this, but in the end the source I used most was more practical and did not have much infomation on what the tasks meant or why.

        <h2>Crtical Evaluation of Assignment</h2>
        In hind sight I would change how I doing several large parts of the assignment, since I feel I relied on if statements too much for basic tasks would could have been rolled into a function which could have been reused. However I did start to move away from using nested foreach loops for simple tasks which could be done by oneline functions included with php. The main example of this is with the find node function which orignally used a foreach solution to find the matching node but I changed this successfully to use x-path. I could have used the same method in several other locations in my script, such as in currPut to validate the currency vs the RESTcountries api data, this would have eliminated one of the loops making the code more efficient.
